# Vue Router Testing

Ionic Framework supports multiple versions of Vue Router. As a result, we need to verify that Ionic works correctly with each of these Vue Router versions.

## Tests

* Tests are found in the `__tests__` directory and use Jest.
* Tests can be run using `npm run test.spec`
* Bug fix and feature PRs should have new tests verifying the PR functionality.
